                    NATURE PHOTOGRAPHY:Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted 
                    to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes
                     and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo
                      than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. 
                    "Nature photography" overlaps the fields of -- and is sometimes considered an overarching category
                     including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography".

                     LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY:Landscape photography is undoubtedly one of the most rewarding and 
                     enjoyable forms of photography. Who doesn’t want to get outside more, to breathe the fresh air,
                      and to connect to nature? Whether your pastime is to capture majestic snow-capped mountain 
                      peaks, the orderly structure of a metropolis skyline, or calm waves lapping at a palm
                       tree-lined island beach, these landscape photography tips will help you make the most of your
                        next photo expedition.

                    ANIMAL PHOTOGRAPHY:concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.
                    As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example,
                     some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds behavior
                      is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require 
                      stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.                    
                    While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successful photography of some 
                    types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, long focal
                     

                        PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY:Portrait photography or portraiture in photography is a photograph 
                        of a person or group of people that captures the personality of the subject by using effective
                         lighting, backdrops, and poses.[1] A portrait picture might be artistic, or it might be clinical,
                         as part of a medical study.[1] Frequently, portraits are commissioned for special occasions, such
                          as weddings or school events.[1] Portraits can serve many purposes, from usage on 
                          a personal Web site to display in the lobby of a business.
